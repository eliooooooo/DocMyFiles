# DocMyFiles Project

This project is about generating custom README files using the OpenAI API. It can extract information from project files and create a detailed README based on that data.

## Dependencies

- **openai** (^4.32.1)
- **fs** (^0.0.1-security)

## Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed, as the project uses a Python script to count tokens.
2. Customize the variables in the `docMyFiles.js` file according to your project needs.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.

## Project Structure

- **tokenCounter.py** - Python script for counting tokens in the text.
- **docMyFiles.js** - Main JavaScript file for generating the README.
- **.env.exemple** - Example file for storing the OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. Run the `docMyFiles.js` script.
2. Customize the variables like `projectPath`, `avoid`, and `description` in the script.
3. The script will read project files and create a README based on the extracted information.
4. You can interact with the script to decide whether to send the request to OpenAI for README generation.
